### Brand Visibility

Control how brands are shared and used within your organisation:
- **Default Visibility**: Newly created brands are visible to all users by default
- **Customised Access**: You can limit visibility and access to specific brands based on teams or users.
  This feature is particularly useful when different business units require separate branding for their documents and communications
<Tip>
  For example, restricting access ensures that only authorised teams can use a specific brand when creating documents, such as a brand used exclusively by a subsidiary.
</Tip>

By customising your brand settings, you can maintain a consistent, professional appearance across all communications while still allowing flexibility for various business areas.
