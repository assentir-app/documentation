## Activities Calendar
The Activities Calendar in Assentir CRM is designed to help you organise and visualise your tasks and appointments. 
It shows activities by start and end dates, making it easier to plan and stay on top of your workload.

- **Due Date Tracking**: Instantly see when tasks are due, helping you prioritise critical activities.
- **End Date Visualisation**: Know when activities are scheduled to finish, allowing you to plan subsequent tasks efficiently.

<Warning>
    Please note that the activities visible in the calendar are determined by user roles.
</Warning>

### Viewing Activities Calendar
To view your activities in a calendar format, **Go to Activities List View** > **Find Calendar Button at the top right conner** > **Open Calendar**

<Tip>
    Assentir CRM remembers your last view preference, so if you select the calendar view, it will be set as your default the next time you access the activities section.

    To switch back to list view, either click on the activities link in the sidebar or use the list view button at the top-right corner of the calendar view.
</Tip>

### Using the Calendar with Activities
The Assentir CRM calendar uses FullCalendar for an interactive and user-friendly experience, making activity management seamless.

- **Drag and Drop**: Move activities to different dates by dragging and dropping. The due date and end date will automatically adjust.
- **Resizing Activities**: You can resize activities directly on the calendar to update their duration
- **Create Activities from the Calendar**: Click on any date to quickly create a new activity. The due date and time will be pre-filled based on the selected calendar slot.
- **Setting Default Calendar View**: You can choose a default view for the calendar based on your preference, ensuring the most relevant information is displayed when you access it.

## Calendar Synchronization
Assentir CRM offers 2-way calendar synchronization with platforms like Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook, ensuring that your schedules are always in sync across platforms.

- **2-way Sync**: Changes made in Assentir CRM or your connected calendar (Google or Outlook) will reflect in both systems, ensuring consistency.
- **Consistent Scheduling**: Never miss an important meeting or task. This feature is especially useful for managing client relationships and deals effectively.

### Stopping Calendar Synchronization
To stop calendar synchronization:

1. Click the **Stop Syncing** button at the top-right corner of the calendar sync interface.
2. Once stopped, Assentir CRM will no longer update events from your connected calendar.
3. If you reconnect later, synchronization will resume from the original connection point, syncing events from that date onward.

## Additional Notes
<Warning>
    - Recurring events in your calendar won't be fully synced, only the initial event.
    - Private events in your Google or Outlook calendar won’t sync to Assentir CRM.
    - Assentir CRM syncs with the primary calendar of the connected account.
    - Moving an event from your primary calendar to another calendar within your provider (Google or Outlook) will remove the event from Assentir CRM. However, moving it back restores it, if still available in the trash.
