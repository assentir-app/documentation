Use Cases

## Getting Started
To start using the Assentir API:

1. **Create an API Key**: You will need an API key, which can be generated in the settings section of your Assentir account. Keep this key secure, as it authenticates all requests.

2. Base URL: All API requests are made to the following base URL:
```arduino
https://{your-workspace}.assentir.com/v1/

```

3. Authentication: Include the API key in the header of all requests for authentication:

```makefile
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
